# webdesign
This is a repository that captures my evolution on a new front- front-end design. It's built entirely using bootstrap and simply served as
a basic prototype for QUEST Alliance's offline repository of content for remote schools and colleges in rural India. In effect, the purpose of using
HTML was purely to improve the User Experience, than in any way to discover online content.. 

Back in July 2015, I learnt how to use Bootstrap and prepared this pair of web pages within 3 days. For these reasons, you will find the
initial commits to be appear fairly rudimentary. However, I aim to use other newer web frameworks like JQuery and Angular to ensure an exciting
and easy-to-use interface for students even in an offline world.
